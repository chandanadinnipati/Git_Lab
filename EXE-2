Main Task
---------------------------------
1. Run the status command. Notice how it tells you what branch you are in.

-git status  #About branch will showed at top 

2. Use the branch command to create a new branch.

-git branch branch1

3. Use the checkout command to switch to it.

-git checkout branch1

4. Make a couple of commits in the branch – perhaps adding a new file and/or editing existing 
ones.

-touch file1.txt file2.txt
-git add file1.txt
-git add file2.txt
-git commit -m "initial commit"
-echo "hello" >file1.txt
-git add file1.txt
-git commit -m "file1 modified"

5. Use the log command to see the latest commits. The two you just made should be at the 
top of the list.

-git log

6. Use the checkout command to switch back to the master branch. Run log again. Notice 
your commits don’t show up now. Check the files also – they should have their original 
contents.

-git checkout master
-git log
-ls -a
-cat file1.txt   #Didn't get content init

7. Use the checkout command to switch back to your branch. Use gitk to take a look at the 
commit graph; notice it’s linear.

-git checkout branch1
-gitk

8. Now checkout the master branch again. Use the merge command to merge your branch in 
to it. Look for information about it having been a fast-forward merge. Look at git log, and 
see that there is no merge commit. Take a look in gitk and see how the DAG is linear.

-git checkout master
-git status
-git merge branch1
-git log
-gitk

9. Switch back to your branch. Make a couple more commits.

-git checkout branch1
-echo "hello">file2.txt
-git add file2.txt
-git commit -m "file2 is added"
-git rm file1.txt
-git commit "removed file1"

10. Switch back to master. Make a commit there, which should edit a different file from the 
ones you touched in your branch – to be sure there is no conflict.

-git checkout master
-touch text1.txt
-echo "hello">text1.txt
-git add text1.txt
-git commit -m "file added"

11. Now merge your branch again. (Aside: you don’t need to do anything to inform Git that you 
only want to merge things added since your previous merge. Due to the way Git works, that 
kind of issue simply does not come up, unlike in early versions of Subversion.)

-git merge branch1

12. Look at git log. Notice that there is a merge commit. Also look in gitk. Notice the DAG 
now shows how things forked, and then were joined up again by a merge commit.

-git log
-gitk

Stretch Task
--------------------------
1. Once again, checkout your branch. Make a couple of commits.

-git checkout branch1
-echo "hii">file1.txt
-git add file1.txt
-git commit -m "modied"

2. Return to your master branch. Make a commit there that changes the exact same line, or 
lines, as commits in your branch did.

-git checkout master
-echo "hello">file1.txt
-git add file1.txt
-git commit -m "modied main"

3. Now try to merge your branch. You should get a conflict.

-git merge branch1   #gets conflit for differnce in file content

4. Open the file(s) that is in conflict. Search for the conflict marker. Edit the file to remove the 
conflict markers and resolve the conflict.

-delete the lines from one of the branches or combine the changes using editers manually

5. Now try to commit. Notice that Git will not allow you to do this when you still have 
potentially unresolved conflicts. Look at the output of status too.

-git commit -m "merge"

6. Use the add command to add the files that you have resolved conflicts in to the staging 
area. Then use commit to commit the merge commit.

-git add file3.txt
-git commit -m "mergei file"

7. Take a look at git log and gitk, and make sure things are as you expected.

-git log
-git look

8. If time allows, you may wish to...
-> Delete everything but your .git directory, then do a checkout command, to prove 
to yourself that this really will restore all of you current working copy.

-git rm -r src  #remove etire directory
-git rm file1.txt file2.txt text1.txt
-ls -a           # no files will exixt except . ,.. ,.git files
-git checkout master
-ls -a     #we get all files

-> Create a situation where one branch has changed a file, but the other branch has 
deleted it. What happens when you try to merge? How will you resolve it?

-git chekout brancn1
-echo "hello">file1.txt
-git add file1.txt
-git commit -m "modified"
-git checkout master
-git rm file1.txt
-git commit -m "deleted"
-git merge branch1          

-> Look at the help page for merge, and find out how you specify a custom message for 
the merge commit if it is automatically generated.

-git help merge
-git merge branch1
-git commit -m "merge automatic commit"  

-> Look at the help page for merge, and find out how to prevent Git from automatically 
committing the merge commit it generates, but instead give you chance to inspect it 
and merge it yourself.

-git help merge
-git merge --no-commit branch1
-git commit -m "commit after inspect"
